# Update Documentation

Scan the codebase and update documentation files (README.md and CLAUDE.md) to reflect current state.

## Instructions

1. **Analyze Recent Changes**
   - Check git status and recent commits to understand what changed
   - Identify new files, modified scripts, or removed components

2. **Scan Codebase Structure**
   - Review `hooks/` directory for any new or modified hooks
   - Check `test/` directory for new test files
   - Look for new directories or significant structural changes

3. **Update README.md**
   - Ensure project description matches current functionality
   - Update installation instructions if setup.sh changed
   - Add/remove component documentation as needed
   - Keep examples current with actual script usage

4. **Update CLAUDE.md**
   - Update repository structure if directories changed
   - Add new commands for any new scripts
   - Update technical details for modified hooks
   - Keep development workflow current
   - Ensure multi-OS compatibility guidelines reflect actual implementation

5. **Validation**
   - Verify all documented commands actually work
   - Ensure file paths in documentation exist
   - Check that code examples match actual implementation

## Guidelines

- Only update sections that are actually outdated
- Don't add redundant information already discoverable from code
- Keep documentation concise and actionable
- Preserve existing style and formatting conventions
- Report what was updated and why
